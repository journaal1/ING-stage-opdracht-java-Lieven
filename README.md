# ZooJava Console Application

---

Welcome to the ZooJava Console Application! This is a simple application that allows you to interact with animals based on their names.

## Available Commands

The following commands have been provided:

- `HELLO`: Say hello to the animals.
- `GIVE_LEAVES`: Feed leaves to the animals.
- `GIVE_MEAT`: Feed meat to the animals.
- `PERFORM_TRICK`: Ask the animals to perform a trick.

## Available Animals in the Zoo

Here are the animals you can interact with:

- DOG named: "woefie"
- HIPPO named: "elsa"
- LION named: "henk"
- MONKEY named: "benny"
- PIG named: "dora"
- TIGER named: "wally"
- ZEBRA named: "marty"

You can use these commands by themselves or specify a specific animal to perform the action. For example:

- `Hello henk`: This will make Henk the Lion react with his hello message.
- If you just write `hello`, all animals will react.
